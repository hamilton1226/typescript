[TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) (TS) is a superset of JavaScript (JS), created at Microsoft
in response to frustration developing large-scale applictions in JS.
It is currently an open-source project hosted on Github.
It supports tools for any browser as well as Node, for any host, on any OS. TTS compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript.

TS adds a flexible type system to JS, in addition to interfaces (custom types) and modifying the syntax of some ECMAScript features such as classes. It supports many upcoming
ECMASCript features (such as async/await). Types allow tooling available in most code editors
that improve the development experience such as code completion and method detection, both in
your own code and in packages you use. It is compatible with all existing JS packages.
TS transpiles to clean, readable JS.
